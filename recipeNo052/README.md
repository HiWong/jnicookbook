# recipe â„– 052 - Calling native method without creating shared library

This sample shows how to register native method that is not exported via shared library. Let's say there is a very simple method (in Java class)

```
public native static int addOne(int a);
```

and we want to call it. However, for the sake of example, I will not use `System.load` or `System.loadLibrary` in order to load the native code. Instead, I will call `RegisterNatives` inside `C` part of the code.

> Look, ma, no System.load.

In this sample, most of the source code is related to initializing `JVM`, then, I am instantiating the class and calling the method `RegisterNatives`. This way, native symbols are available for `JVM` even though they don't follow typical naming convention for native code called from `JVM`.

# Building and running

The easiest way to build and run codes is to clone the repo and run the sample.

    > git clone https://github.com/mkowsiak/jnicookbook.git
    > cd jnicookbook/recipeNo052
    > make all
    > make test
    > make clean
