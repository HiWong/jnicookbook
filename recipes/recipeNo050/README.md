# recipe â„– 050 - how to get location of JAR file

From time to time you would like to know what is the location of class loaded by class loader. When it comes to `JAR`, sometimes it's good to know it's exact location on file system. In `Java` it's fairly easy to achieve

```
return new File( Main.class
                .getProtectionDomain()
                .getCodeSource()
                .getLocation()
                .toURI())
                .getPath();
```

It may become a little bit cumbersome while you want to do it using `JNI` based calls. There is simply lots of code you have to write. Take a look at the sources inside `c` directory to get the feeling of how to do it.
